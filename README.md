## Usage instructions

To use the app, all you need to do is navigate to the [url](https://tkerekes10.github.io/Schedule-your-day/) and there you will find text inputs for you to overwrite with items that need to be completed during the day. Once you have added your action items to the time hour block, you will want to click the save button. Once the text is saved, upon reload of the app, the saved text will display in the correct section. This is crucial so you do not forget what is planned!
